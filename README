**********************THIS PROJECT WASN'T RELEASED AT ALL********************

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is currently in alpha development state, which means that it's
completely unusable and requires some time to have its first version. So
don't be surprised if you see weird package names, unfinished code, test
code, etc..

This is fucking game engine, dude, it requires some work to make even initial
state for that.

p.s. we have no docs yet :(
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is light-weight game engine, based on LWJGL. We gonna support all the
cool features from libGDX, for make development process more comfortable and
easier to get in. Target platforms: Linux/Windows/OSX and that's it. No mobile
or console platforms are planning to support, but how knows what it could be
in the future :)
